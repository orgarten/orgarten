### Hi there, I am Orell ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance engineer working in computational engineering. 

I started this journey in computational electromagnetics, simulation wave propagation for space-born radar applications. From there I kept digging deeper into ray-tracing based simulation methods. I have published several papers in the field. 

Besides that, for about 2 years I tried to start several startups in the field of computational engineering. During this time I gained a lof of experience beyong the technical side of things.

My main tech stack is based on C++, Python and Linux but I am always open to learning new things.


- ðŸ”­ I'm always open for new opportunities in:
  - consulting and software engioneering computational fields and signal processing
  - RF engineering consulting
  - General software engineering in C++ and Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about computational engineering, C++ & Python, and RF engineering.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ogarten/) or send me.
