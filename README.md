### Hi there, I am Orell 👋

I am an engineer passionate about computational engineering. My first introduction to this field was creating custom simulation algorithms to siimulate wave propagation in a space-application. From there I kept digging deeper, especially into ray-tracing based simulation methods.

Besides that, for about 2 years I tried to start several startups in the field of computational engineering. During this time I gained a lof of experience beyong the technical side of things.

My main tech stack is based on C++, Python and Linux but I am always open to learning new things.

I am open for contracting.
