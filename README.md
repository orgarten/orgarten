### Hi there, I am Orell 👋

I am a software engineer with focus on connecting the physical and digital world. Moving data between devices and systems for computing and analysis is one of the things I have enjoyed doing in past projects. 

I have more than 5 years of experience in algorithm and software development for different use cases. I usually code in C++ and Python and use cloud providers for deployment. I am always open to learning new things. 

Techwise, I like to work with Python, C++, Linux and cloud-based services but I am always open to learning new things.

I am open for contracting.
